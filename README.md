# Android-Malware-Dataset
Android malware has emerged as the most serious threat to the widely used Android ecosystem. Several machine learning-based techniques for detecting Android malware are continually being developed. Permissions are extracted from Malware and Benign applications in their respective folders using jadx, a Dex to Java decompiler through which each APK is unpacked and permissions are extracted using AndroidManifest.xml by setting the status to permission list which exists in Perm List and it constantly updating the list, and then combined into a single Comma Separated Values (.csv) for use in machine learning techniques. The first column provides the "NAME" of the relevant APK, while the last column "CLASS" indicates if the application corresponds to the benign or malware training set. [Benign=0, Malware=1], in between Name and Class all are of permissions [0=The android application does not use this permission, 1=The Android application uses this permission].
