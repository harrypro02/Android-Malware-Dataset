# DATA COLLECTION
The APK samples  was gathered from AndroZoo, which is a growing repository of Android apps extracted from a variety of sources, including the official Google Play app store. It currently contains 15,510,743 APKs, each of which has been (or will soon be) analyzed by dozens of Antivirus products to determine which applications are classified as Malware.

This was started in 2016 by researchers from the University of Luxembourg and is still growing. For this experiment, 10,686 APKs from AndroZoo were selected from 2013 to 2016 by filtering them by virus total detection with 0 to 30+ in order to obtain higher certainty of malware samples, allowing for efficient and broad Android application markets to be included.

# ML DATASET GENERATION

A.	Feature extraction
Android applications are packaged as APK archives. The manifest, AndroidManifest.xml, is a critical component of this file. Android manifest.xml contains several elements, including the package name, permissions. App permissions protect user privacy by limiting access to Restricted data (such as device state and a user's contact information) and Restricted actions.
B.	Data set generation
Android malware has emerged as the most serious threat to the widely used Android ecosystem. Several machine learning-based techniques for detecting Android malware are continually being developed.
Permissions are extracted from Malware and Benign applications in their respective folders using jadx, a Dex to Java decompiler through which each APK is unpacked and permissions are extracted using AndroidManifest.xml by setting the status to permission list which exists in Perm List and it constantly updating the list, and then combined into a single Comma Separated Values (.csv) for use in machine learning techniques.
